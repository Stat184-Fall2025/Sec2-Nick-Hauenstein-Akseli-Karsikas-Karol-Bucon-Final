# Defense VS Offense In the Big Games
Defense wins championships! Or does Offense actually do it?
## Overview

One of the most widely known sayings in sports is that defense wins championships, but is this actually true? While strong defense is often credited for success, offensive performance may play an equally important role in championship games. In this project, we analyze team statistics from recent Super Bowl matchups to examine whether offense or defense is more strongly associated with winning the biggest games. Using real NFL data, we compare offensive and defensive rankings of both winners and losers to explore which factors appear most influential.

### Key Findings
1. When looking at the rank of the last five winners defense PF vs offense PF ranks, it looks like offense is more important for the team to win, having 3/5 with a higher offensive rank than defensive.

2. According to the figure above, it actually appears that even when the defense is ranked lower than the offense of the opponent, they still can come out on top

3. As you can see in the figure above, the defensive ranks between the winner and loser are actually very close.

4. As shown in this figure, having a better offense wins 3/5 times.

## Current Plan

The current plan is to work together to get our data into r and wrangle it to get what we need and then properly display that to analysis our data were using.

## Repo Structure

This repository contains the Quarto (.qmd) file used for analysis as well as the rendered PDF report. Together, these files document both the analytical workflow in R and the final results of the project.
