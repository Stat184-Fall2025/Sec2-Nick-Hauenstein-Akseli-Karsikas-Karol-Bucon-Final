# Defense VS Offense In the Big Games
Defense wins championships! Or does Offense actually do it?
## Overview

One of the biggest most widely know sayings in the sports world is defense wins championships but have we actually doubted this? Who says its actually the reason teams win. What if the offense is more important in championship games. In this project we will use statistics and analysis to really determine what is more crucial to success. We will create a report that gives an in depth analysis of offense vs defense from championship games to see what was the determining factor in the big games. 

### Key Findings
1. When looking at the rank of the last five winners defense PF vs offense PF ranks it looks like offense is more important for the team to win having 4/5 with higher offensive rank than defensive.

2. According to the figure above it actually appears that even when the defense is ranked lower than the offense of the opponent they still can come out on top
